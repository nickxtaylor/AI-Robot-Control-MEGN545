This repository contains code I wrote for a graduate class at Colorado School of Mines called Advanced Robot Control.
This class focuses on non-traditional dynamics and controls techniques focusing on machine learning and AI.
The course covers neural network fundamentals, model predictive controllers, fuzzy logic controllers and reinforcement learning agents with Q-learning optimization. 
The code in this repo contains MATLAB & Simulink code for the homeworks and projects from this class.
