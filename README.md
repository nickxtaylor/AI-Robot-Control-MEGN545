This repository contains code I wrote for a graduate class at Colorado School of Mines called ADvanced Robot Control.
This class focuses on non-traditional machine learning or AI robot control theory techniques. 
The course covers neural network fundamentals, model predictive controllers, fuzzy logic controllers and reinforcement learning agents with Q-learning optimization. 
The code in this repo contains MATLAB & Simulink code for the homeworks and projects from this class. 
Project Part 3 uses a given plant model to build a Q-learning RL agent to control a quadrotor to follow a square trajectory.
